The Stepwise Palace
===================

A poem which I published on my twitter account,
[@FSVO](https://twitter.com/FSVO) in 2013. It's a not-quite-unserious
parody of a more or less forgotten genre, the narrative verses
glorifying natural science of writers like Erasmus Darwin (grandfather
of the more famous Charles) and also an exercise in writing around a
mathematical framework.

This repository includes the code I wrote to help me work out the
structure of the poem, and a small utility for writing out an HTML version with internal links that may help people deduce the underlying structure.
