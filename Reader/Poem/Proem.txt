Fig Proem
MNEMOSYNE, Mother Muse, thine aid
Thy loyal servant humbly dares to ask
To consecrate the Palace I have made
To tell where nimble Matter in its Masque
On Earth, in Heaven, in Alembick flask
In childish coyness, never to be seen
Without great labour, bold SCIENTIA'S task,
Of all the mortal arts the regnant Queen
Mistress of all that was, that is, and will have been.
