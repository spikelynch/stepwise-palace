Design for a first public view of the poem.

Principles -

It should be possibly to read the poem in the order in which it was
published. Unless otherwise stated, "next" in this doc means the next stanza
in this order

The view at any one time is a slice of nine stanzas.

One stanza at a time should be highlighted (or easily readable)

The most basic behaviour is to move to the next stanza, but it should
also be possible to do other "natural" moves - a move is a step to an
adjacent node.

There should be a few design hints as to the meanings of the four
dimensions (2 = elements, temporal, and high/low) but nothing too
explicit

----------

Most obvious design is a 3x3 slice with the current stanza in normal 
style

For the dimensions:

low-middle-high: Y axis

past-present-future: X axis

Elements: colours

Fire (N)   - red     (S red, orange)
Earth (E)  - yellow  (N brown, green)
Water (S)  - green   (W blue)
Air (W)    - blue   - (E light blue, white, bright yellow
