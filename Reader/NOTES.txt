Design for a first public view of the poem.

Principles -

It should be possibly to read the poem in the order in which it was
published. Unless otherwise stated, "next" in this doc means the next stanza
in this order

The view at any one time is a slice of nine stanzas.

One stanza at a time should be highlighted (or easily readable)

The most basic behaviour is to move to the next stanza, but it should
also be possible to do other "natural" moves - a move is a step to an
adjacent node.

There should be a few design hints as to the meanings of the four
dimensions (2 = elements, temporal, and high/low) but nothing too
explicit

----------

Most obvious design is a 3x3 slice with the current stanza in normal 
style

For the dimensions:

low-middle-high: Y axis

past-present-future: X axis

Elements: colours (see below)

Here are the coordinate names

X  air-null-earth
Y  water-null-fire
Z  low-ground-high
T  past-present-future

Screen coords are U (X) and V (Y)

Options for slices
Free       Constrained          Map to screen
X Y        Z and T constant     U = X   V = Y
X Z        Y and T constant     U = X   V = Z
X T        Y and Z constant     U = T   V = X
Y Z        X and T constant     U = Y   V = Z
Y T        X and Z constant     U = T   V = Y
Z T        X and Y constant     U = T	V = Z

How many slices are possible for a given cell?

By class (A to E, where A is the centre and E are the corners)

  
   XY XZ XT YZ YT ZT

A   *  *  *  *  *  *  = 6
B  


-------------------------
After a swim:

Every room can be found in a vertical slice with the screen y-axis
corresponding to the heavens / ground / deeps axis.  The only thing
that changes is what to map the x-axis onto, and where to slice the 
cube.

A heuristic for a natural path:  when moving to room A, look for the
next one in the sequence - B - and find a vertical slice which contains
both A and B (if one exists).  

If one exists, rotate to move that slice to the display.

If not, stay on this slice and rotate to B after the user is ready to 
move on.






Notes on color choices

Fire (N)   - red     (S red, orange)
Earth (E)  - yellow  (N brown, green)
Water (S)  - green   (W blue)
Air (W)    - blue   - (E light blue, white, bright yellow



Electricity   Fire         Lava
(violet)     (orange)     (red)

Air                        Earth
(lt blue)                 (dk red)

Ice           Water        Mud
