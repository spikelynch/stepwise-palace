Abandoning the hypercube approach, it's too hard to do in a format
which allows the poem to be readable.

The transition model:

* Square div which contains the current stanza, centered

* Very ghostly traces of the previous and next stanzas, but no others.
  Neighbour stanzas are "off the edge" in the appropriate direction.

* Mapping of 4-D directions onto the page, as follows:

  Vertical maps onto vertical.

  Temporal is "in" and "out" - a shift in Z perspective.  The past is 
  further away, the future is closer

  Horizontal is mapped onto left <-> right as if we were outside the
  palace and rotating it (or rotating around it):

  so   

  ELECT   FIRE    LAVA


  AIR              EARTH


  ICE     WATER   MUD



becomes   AIR -- ICE -- WATER -- MUD -- EARTH -- LAVA -- FIRE -- ELECT -- AIR


  Voids are treated as another kind of horizontal movement (as if taking a
  shortcut)

   AIR -- VOID -- EARTH  etc.

 
When moving from stanza n to stanza n+1: find the transition dimension
and do a jquery transition on four stanzas:

Stanza          From               To

n - 1           Ghosted, behind    Hidden
n               Full, centre       Ghosted, behind
n + 1           Ghosted, ahead     Full, centre
n + 2           Hidden             Ghosted, ahead

Meaning of 'behind', 'ahead':

For any pair of stanzas a, a+1 there is a transition, which is a signed  dimension   IE vertical, + (up).  Or temporal, - (into the past).

Each of the eight possible transitions has a page equivalent - some of which
overlap (the horizontal/element transitions are a special case because we
treat two dimensions as a single dimension wrapped around a cylinder.


OTHER VISUAL CUES - for later.

A colour for each of the element combinations:

AIR               Blue
ICE               Cyan
WATER             Green
MUD               Brown
EARTH             Yellow
LAVA              Orange        
FIRE              Red           
ELECTRICITY       Purple

Textures: strata/waves for the DEEPS.
          a horizon line for   GROUND
          stars/circles for    HEAVENS























Principles -

It should be possibly to read the poem in the order in which it was
published. Unless otherwise stated, "next" in this doc means the next stanza
in this order

The view at any one time is a slice of nine stanzas.

One stanza at a time should be highlighted (or easily readable)

The most basic behaviour is to move to the next stanza, but it should
also be possible to do other "natural" moves - a move is a step to an
adjacent node.

There should be a few design hints as to the meanings of the four
dimensions (2 = elements, temporal, and high/low) but nothing too
explicit

----------

Most obvious design is a 3x3 slice with the current stanza in normal 
style

For the dimensions:

low-middle-high: Y axis

past-present-future: X axis

Elements: colours (see below)

Here are the coordinate names

X  air-null-earth
Y  water-null-fire
Z  low-ground-high
T  past-present-future

Screen coords are U (X) and V (Y)

Options for slices
Free       Constrained          Map to screen
X Y        Z and T constant     U = X   V = Y
X Z        Y and T constant     U = X   V = Z
X T        Y and Z constant     U = T   V = X
Y Z        X and T constant     U = Y   V = Z
Y T        X and Z constant     U = T   V = Y
Z T        X and Y constant     U = T	V = Z

How many slices are possible for a given cell?

By class (A to E, where A is the centre and E are the corners)

  
   XY XZ XT YZ YT ZT

A   *  *  *  *  *  *  = 6
B  


-------------------------
After a swim:

Every room can be found in a vertical slice with the screen y-axis
corresponding to the heavens / ground / deeps axis.  The only thing
that changes is what to map the x-axis onto, and where to slice the 
cube.

A heuristic for a natural path:  when moving to room A, look for the
next one in the sequence - B - and find a vertical slice which contains
both A and B (if one exists).  

If one exists, rotate to move that slice to the display.

If not, stay on this slice and rotate to B after the user is ready to 
move on.

-------------------------

Algorithm for which slice.

A slice is defined by the two fixed coordinate and their values. For
eg, X=1, Y=-1.

All slices must have Z free (so that the vertical coordinates can map
onto screen-Y)

Two adjacent cells => differ in one coordinate only: the step-coordinate

If step == Z: U = ( X, Y or T ), Y = Z
If step != Z: U = ( STEP ), Y = Z

Fire (N)   - red     (S red, orange)
Earth (E)  - yellow  (N brown, green)
Water (S)  - green   (W blue)
Air (W)    - blue   - (E light blue, white, bright yellow



Electricity   Fire         Lava
(violet)     (orange)     (red)

Air                        Earth
(lt blue)                 (dk red)

Ice           Water        Mud
