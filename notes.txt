Have a path 










16 E, 32 D

D -> E -> D ->  D -> E -> D ...

24 C

between D -> C -> D have to repeat through some Cs

Same with C -> B -> C because there are only 8 B

E 16
D 24
C 32
B 8

E 2
D 3
C 4
B 1

E D C B C D C D E D  

E 1 1 1 1
D 0 1 1 1
C 0 0 1 1

D 1 1 0 1
C 1 0 0 1
D 1 0 1 1
E 1 -1 1 1
D 0 -1 1 1





E -> 16
D -> 32
C -> 24
B -> 8
A -> 1
